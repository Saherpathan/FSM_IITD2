# Supervised Learning - Regression 📈

This repository contains an implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm from scratch in Python using Numpy and Pandas for the task of regression.

## Overview ℹ️

In this project, we implement Linear Regression, a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks. Linear Regression aims to establish a linear relationship between input features and a continuous target variable. This implementation provides a clear understanding of how Linear Regression works and demonstrates its implementation from scratch using Python.

## Implementation Details 🛠️

### Libraries Used 📚

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical computing.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For data visualization.

### Linear Regression 🔍

- Linear Regression is implemented to predict continuous target variable values based on input features.
- The algorithm calculates the coefficients using the normal equation.
- The predictions are made using the learned coefficients.

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/supervised-learning-regression.git
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

3. Run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python linear_regression.py
    ```
